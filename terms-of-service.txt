Welcome to App Roulette! By accessing or using our app, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.

1. Account Creation and Access
To use our app, you must create an account by providing a username, email address, and password. This information is required to track your deleted apps and upload them to our database. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.

2. Permissions and Access
Our app requires permission to access your deviceâ€™s storage to delete apps. By granting these permissions, you allow us to manage app deletions as per the functionality of the app.

3. App Features
Spinning the Wheel: You can spin the wheel to delete apps from your device. You may spin the wheel as often as you like.
Viewing Deleted Apps: You can view apps that you have previously deleted.
Viewing Other Users' Deleted Apps: You can see which apps have been deleted by other users for comedic purposes.
Account Management: You can log out of your account and connect to a different one at any time.

5. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. If we make significant changes, you will be notified via email. Upon entering the app after a change, you will be prompted to agree to the updated terms. Your continued use of the app after such updates signifies your acceptance of the new terms.

6. Permissions and Access Control
Once you agree to grant access to storage, this permission remains active until you are prompted to agree again in the future.

Our app is designed to delete only manually installed and non-essential apps. While we strive to ensure that our app functions correctly, we are not responsible for any issues caused by the deletion of apps, including those that are crucial to the functionality of your device.
By using the app, you acknowledge that the deletion of apps is performed at your own risk. We are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the deletion of apps, whether essential or non-essential.

We reserve the right to terminate your account if you violate these Terms of Service or for any other reason deemed necessary. Upon termination, you will not be able to use the app.
